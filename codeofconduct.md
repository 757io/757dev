# 757dev Slack Team Code of Conduct

All members of our Slack group are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout all channels. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.

tl;dr: Be excellent with each other

## The Quick Version

Our Slack group is dedicated to providing a harassment-free communication experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of Slack participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Slack participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the Slack group at the discretion of the Slack group organizers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption of channels or other mediums, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Slack staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized content or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the Slack group organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the Slack group.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the Slack group staff immediately. Slack group staff can be identified through the Team Directory.

Slack group staff will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of their time in our Slack group. We value your contribution.
